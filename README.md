# ASP.NET Core 2.2 - API for User Management, Authentication and Registration

Basically forked and updated this repo http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2018/06/26/aspnet-core-21-simple-api-for-authentication-registration-and-user-management

## Getting Started

Clone the repo

```
git clone <repo-name>
```

1. Open Solution in Visual Studio
2. Open Package Manager Console
3. `Update-Database`  - this will create the database from the existing migration file in Migrations folder
4. Run solution - by default it will launch localhost on port 50110 but that is configurable in Properties/launchSettings.json.  NOTE: If you do change it, you'll need to change in the corresponding front-end app.
5. Run the client Tekeys app
